      "you.\n",

      "\n",
      "HAMLET. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights\n",

      "our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could\n",

      "discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I\n",
      "have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all\n",
      "custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition\n",
      "that this goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory;\n",
      "this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave oâ€™erhanging\n",
      "firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it\n",
      "appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of\n",
      "vapours. What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason? How infinite\n",
      "in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable? In action\n",
      "how like an angel? In apprehension, how like a god? The beauty of the\n",
      "world, the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this\n",
      "quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman neither,\n",
      "though by your smiling you seem to say so.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Why did you laugh then, when I said â€˜Man delights not meâ€™?\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten\n",
      "entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them on the\n",
      "way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. He that plays the king shall be welcome,â€”his Majesty shall have\n",
      "tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target;\n",
      "the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in\n",
      "peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle aâ€™ thâ€™\n",
      "sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall\n",
      "halt forâ€™t. What players are they?\n",

      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there\n",
